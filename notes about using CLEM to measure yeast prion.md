# notes about using CLEM to measure yeast prion

## From *In vivo evidence for the fibrillar structures of Sup35 prions in yeast cells*

### Introduction

##### Amyloids in general

- highly ordered fibrillar protein aggregates with a cross β-sheet structure
- binds Congo red and thioflavin dyes
- some aggregates with **nonpathological** origins

##### Sup35 - Representative examples of such nonpathological amyloid formation

- normally functions as a **translation termination factor**
- aggregated forms in [*PSI+*]
- Hsp104, a **chaperone** which disassembles protein aggregates in an ATP-dependent manner with the aid of the Hsp70/40 system
- Sup35 fused with GFP gives rise to the formation of visible spherical aggregates, called **foci**, in the cytosol
- Besides, rod- or ring-shaped aggregates may also be formed when Sup35NM-GFP is overexpressed in *[psi−] cells* and in *[PSI+] cells treated with 3–5 mM guanidine hydrochloride* (cure [*PSI+*] by perturbing Hsp104)

##### foci

- not dead-end complexes - can be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as diffuse oligomers
- formed by the **N-terminal** (N) and **middle (M) domains** of Sup35 fused with GFP (**Sup35NM-GFP**)

##### 过往观察

In Vitro:

> recombinant Sup35 proteins bearing the prion-determining N-terminal domain form fibrils with a diameter of ∼10–20 nm ([Glover et al., 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930275/#bib10); [Kishimoto et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930275/#bib17); [Krzewska and Melki, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930275/#bib20))

suggested the existence of amyloid fibrils in vivo:

1. Sup35 aggregates in [*PSI+*] cells are **stained by an amyloid-staining dye**, thioflavin S, suggesting the presence of cross β-sheet structures in [*PSI+*] cells ([Kimura et al., 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930275/#bib16)). 
2. an EM analysis of Sup35 oligomers **isolated** from [*PSI+*] lysates revealed ∼20-nm-wide barrels and larger structures (bundles; [Bagriantsev et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930275/#bib3)). 
3. the induction of the **[*PSI+*] phenotype** by the **expression** of recombinant Sup35 implied that [*PSI+*] cells contained amyloid fibrils originating from Sup35 ([Tanaka et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930275/#bib33)).（因为过表达Sup35可以诱导prion表型[*PSI+*]说明[*PSI+*]细胞内有聚集成淀粉状的Sup35？）

So far there is no **direct** evidence, , and the **detailed structure** is not known.
