# some notes from *Recent Progress in Understanding the Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in Plant Cell Signaling*

> Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in understanding the cross talk between organelles in orchestrating the cellular redox state temporally and spatially. ROS function as oxidants of proteins altering their function and of lipids releasing signal-active compounds.

> Our most detailed knowledge of ROS functions still comes from work with photosynthesizing leaves; therefore, the majority of reports in this special issue focus on leaf processes. Other contributions address ROS-dependent regulation of flower senescence ([Rogers and Munné-Bosch, 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-35)), polar growth of pollen and root hairs ([Mangano et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-27)), and other root processes, including root architecture formation ([Evans et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-11); [Liu et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-25)).

### In vivo ROS imaging in cells and tissues has contributed significantly to many of the recent advances in understanding ROS signaling.

> Thus, the majority of studies presented in this Focus Issue employed fluorescein-based probes such as the 1O2 sensory fluorescein anthracene Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green ([Koh et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-23)) or the H2O2 probe OxyBurst Green (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate;[Evans et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-11); [Zhang et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-46)). These newer probes offer sensitive and more reliable readouts but are difficult to apply to some tissues like leaves, and their specificity is still disputed ([Winterbourn, 2014](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-45)). Genetically encoded sensors such as the ratiometric HyPer and HyPerRed were also used for ROS and redox detection in previous studies ([Chiu et al., 2014](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-6); [Ermakova et al., 2014](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-10)). A major advantage for future plant ROS research would be to standardize protocols for in vivo cell imaging. 

### Redox interactions between intracellular compartments are key to stress responses and developmental processes.

> Organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes are powerful generators of ROS and other redox signals... Coordination of gene expression between the three genomes of the plant cell requires monitoring of chloroplast and mitochondrial status, to allow appropriate retrograde signaling to the nucleus ([Kleine and Leister, 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-22)).

## the homeostasis

> However, plentiful reductant not only favors ROS removal but also can promote ROS production ([Foyer and Noctor, 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-13)). Consequently, there is a delicate balance between the reductant-dependent production of ROS and the metabolism of these oxidizing compounds.

> As discussed in this issue, our knowledge of ROS concentrations at specific locations is still very incomplete ([Noctor and Foyer, 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-32)).

> Oxidation-triggered adjustments in compounds such as glutathione may be important in ROS signaling ([Han et al., 2013](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-16)).

> This underscores the complexity of ROS and redox homeostasis inside the cell, a view reinforced by the finding that accepted antioxidant enzymes such as monodehydroascorbate reductase may have pro-oxidant roles under some conditions ([Johnston et al., 2015](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-19)).

> Among the most sensitive targets for peroxides are thiol peroxidases like glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxins. Oxidized peroxiredoxins oxidize redox transmitters such as thioredoxins, which in turn oxidize target proteins.

> In addition, they may serve as proximity-based oxidase and redox-dependent interaction partners ([Dietz, 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-8)). Highly sensitive, untargeted or targeted, mass spectrometry combined with flexible use of blocking, labeling, and detection represent important steps forward for dissecting the dynamic and early modifications of redox proteins ([Jones and Sies, 2015](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-20)).

> Maintaining the balance between labile iron and ROS is critical for the growth and health of plants preventing the formation of the highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. A recent study explored the link between the ROS-response ZAT12 zinc finger protein and iron regulation in cells.

> When ZAT12 is up-regulated in response to ROS accumulation, it therefore suppresses iron uptake and prevents the risk of hydroxyl radical formation. 

> ROS and calcium waves constitute important components of rapid systemic signaling in plants (e.g. [Suzuki et al., 2013](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-37); [Choi et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-7); [Evans et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-11); [Carmody et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-4)).

> and a new report by [Carmody et al., (2016)](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-4) in this Focus Issue proposes a role for singlet oxygen as an initiator of systemic ROS signals. 

> Linked to RBOH function, MAP kinase pathways integrate ROS signals orchestrating a cellular response to abiotic and biotic stress, as well as control hormone-signaling pathways and stomatal closure ([Sierla et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-36)) and modulate cell-to-cell signal propagation in local and systemic signaling ([Evans et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-11); [Gilroy et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-15)). MAP kinase pathways participate in retrograde signaling from the chloroplast to the nucleus ([Vogel et al., 2014](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-41); [Dietz et al., 2016](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1535.full#ref-9)). Thus, MAP kinase pathways are of fundamental and far-reaching significance in converting ROS signals into protein phosphorylation.
