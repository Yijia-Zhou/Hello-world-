## SUBCELLULAR REDOX TRANSPORT AND COMPARTMENTATION

chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria are the key redox-active compartments

In chloroplasts, ascorbate peroxidases ([APX](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-7)s) and 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are the front-line defenses against [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) accumulation ([Dietz, 2011](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-19); [Awad et al., 2015](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-4)). 

Other compartments such as the mitochondria, peroxisomes, and cytosol contain [APX](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-7). The reducing substrates required by these antioxidative peroxidases are supplied by several systems that depend on **ferredoxin, NAD(P)H, and glutathione**.

antioxidants could play roles in transmitting [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1)signaling - an antioxidant is defined as a compound that outcompetes others in reacting with [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) to give a relatively stable oxidized product.

![img](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581/F1.large.jpg)

Such specificities could explain differences in ROS sensitivity between different compartments or between the same compartment under different conditions. 



Differences in the composition and complement of such redox-active antioxidant components may be among the factors contributing to the specificity of signaling at each location



**Our knowledge of the subcellular movement of redox-active metabolites such as [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2), glutathione, and ascorbate is very incomplete.**

With the exceptions noted below, many of the transporters remain to be characterized at the molecular level.



Chloroplast and mitochondrial outer membranes are permeable to most metabolites, although attention has been drawn to possible selectivity even at this level ([Bölter and Soll, 2001](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-8)).

gray indicates aquaporin or other **H2O2** transporter; In the case of chloroplasts, these aquaporins were shown to be crucial to the movement of **CO2**.



Although mitochondria are the site of the final step of ascorbate synthesis, the compound is produced in the intermembrane space, meaning that import into the matrix is required ([Szarka et al., 2013](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-77)).



For glutathione: 

which transporters may be involved in determining the redistribution of the disulfide form (oxidized glutathione [[GSSG](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-4)]) during oxidative stress. 



For ascorbate:

systems have not yet been characterized that ensure ascorbate transport across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen to support violaxanthin deepoxidase activity and other biochemical functions.



Chloroplasts and mitochondria also house systems that can **transfer NAD(P)-linked metabolites** to ensure the exchange of redox equivalents. These systems allow the indirect transfer of redox equivalents across membranes at much **more rapid rates** than can occur through the direct transport of pyridine nucleotides, which are **relatively large and highly charged metabolites.**



Dicarboxylate transporters:

exchange redox equivalents as malate and oxaloacetate ([Kinoshita et al., 2011](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-44)).



The redox-regulated chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase:

function together with chloroplast envelope dicarboxylate transporters to avoid overreduction in the stroma by transferring reducing equivalents to the cytosol ([Scheibe et al., 2005](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-69)).



the chloroplast envelope phosphate translocator:

exchange triose phosphate for phosphate as a chloroplast-cytosol carbon exporter or triose phosphate for 3-phosphoglycerate as a reductant (and ATP) exporter.



Plant aquaporins present on the plasma membrane and tonoplast:

assumed to play roles in H2O2 signaling or regulation, but these studies have mainly been done in **heterologous systems**, and a key outstanding question is the direction of **net movement** within plant cells.

Based on the **ROS-producing** capacities of chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, one might expect them to influence ROS movement as **net exporters**. However, these organelles also house **highly active antioxidative enzymes**, meaning that they also could function as **ROS sinks**.

## SUBCELLULAR DISTRIBUTION OF H2O2, ANTIOXIDANTS, AND PYRIDINE NUCLEOTIDES

H2O2 is more stable, and attempts to quantify this molecule in extracts of plant tissues often produce quite high values.



Accurate determination of subcellular metabolite concentrations is a challenging task:

- disruption of organelles or transporter activities may alter the metabolite distribution during sample preparation
- instability (particularly of redox states) following tissue disruption.

Nonaqueous(非水溶液) extraction of organelles from tissue or very rapid fractionation of protoplasts (within seconds) can minimize these problems. More recent approaches have involved in situ labeling with specific antibodies for ascorbate and glutathione ([Zechmann et al., 2008](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-90), [2011](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-91)).

![Ｔａｂｌｅ１](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/3072722-967aa3fcebd7cbbe.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

- ascorbate is highly reduced in all compartments apart from the vacuole and apoplast

- the reduction state is very high in many compartments, with most of the GSSG present in the vacuole or apoplast

- pyridine nucleotide pools are at more reduced states in the mitochondria than in the cytosol and chloroplast. 

  Relatively oxidized pools of NAD and NADP are probably required for the operation of **glycolysis** in the cytosol and the **photosynthetic electron transport chain** in the chloroplast.



H2O2 - there is little reliable information available in the literature on concentrations in different compartments

Measured [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) contents in plant extracts are rarely lower than 100 nmol g−1fresh weight, translating to a global concentration of around 100 μM if [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) is uniformly distributed. This is **well above** accepted concentrations in organisms such as animals and yeast.

Data in the table(other than the **vacuole**) infered by the **affinities** of the major [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2)-removing peroxidases, known **inhibition** of important enzymes by [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) and so on.



The **vacuolar concentration** is estimated assuming that [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) will result mainly from movement from the cytosol without active transport, tending to equilibrium on both sides of the tonoplast. We infer the **high concentrations in the apoplast** based on the presence of numerous [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1)-producing systems, a relatively weak antioxidative system, and ***the need to account for reported values of [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2).***



[Table I](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#T1) refers largely to mesophyll(叶肉) cells and does not consider tissues such as the vasculature, where [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) concentrations remain poorly characterized.

Possible compartmentation of this type needs to be taken into account in assessing the relevance of [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) contents measured in whole tissue extracts.



## THE CYTOSOL AS A KEY SITE OF REDOX SIGNAL INTEGRATION

Redox reactions taking place in the cytosol are essential for the maintenance of the metabolic competence of the cell and for the regulation of translation ([Benina et al., 2015](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#ref-5)). 

The cytosol, therefore, is much more than a buffer zone between the organelles and the nucleus, particularly since post-translational modifications of the translational apparatus allow very fast and highly effective control of protein synthesis.

Oxidative signaling can be mediated via the regulation of translation and, hence, protein production



Where does cytosolic H2O2 come from? This question cannot as yet be answered unequivocally, but it may originate largely from organelles such as chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria as well as import from the apoplast.



Studies of the effects of mutations for cytosolic antioxidative enzymes in the wild-type and *cat2*backgrounds point to a key role for this compartment in dealing with excess [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2) and the resulting signaling.

> Here we show that protection of nuclear DNA in plants requires a coordinated function of ROS-scavenging pathways residing in the cytosol and peroxisomes, demonstrating that nuclear ROS scavengers such as peroxiredoxin and glutathione are insufficient to safeguard DNA integrity.

>
> peroxisomal catalases (perCat) 



stresses such as wounding or drought produce a more oxidized cytosol

These changes in the cytosolic redox potential may play some role in oxidative signaling, but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

It is clear that **thiol-related redox** changes drive key cytosol-nucleus signaling in some stresses...

It may be that stress-induced changes in **glutathione redox potential** accompany an **integrated** cellular response.



## ORGANELLAR REDOX SIGNALING: REACHING OUT TO THE NUCLEUS

Because most of the proteins within these organelles are now encoded by nuclear genes, there has to be intimate communication to ensure coordinated expression of components involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and other processes. This notably involves the modification of nuclear gene expression by signals originating in organelles, a process referred to as retrograde signaling.



there is direct regulation of gene expression within the organelle by the reduction state of photosynthetic electron transport chain components.But it is less clear how.

> What accounts for the retention of genes for the complete synthesis within chloroplasts and mitochondria of a tiny minority of their protein subunits? One hypothesis is that expression of genes for protein subunits of energy-transducing enzymes must respond to physical environmental change by means of a direct and unconditional regulatory control—control exerted by change in the redox state of the corresponding gene product. This hypothesis proposes that, to preserve function, an entire redox regulatory system has to be retained within its original membrane-bound compartment. Colocation of gene and gene product for redox regulation of gene expression (CoRR) is a hypothesis in agreement with the results of a variety of experiments designed to test it and which seem to have no other satisfactory explanation.

> A redox sensor responds, by autophosphorylation, to a change in the redox state of an electron carrier. Phosphoryl transfer to a specific response regulator then initiates or inhibits a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase through the action of a regulatory sigma factor that is specific to a particular promoter. 

- Among the possible signals, the roles of [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) have been much discussed (Analysis of multiple data sets led to the conclusion that different types of [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) produced at different subcellular sites trigger distinct transcriptomic signatures)
- Other signals, such as heme or its breakdown products, probably also are important. 
- Retrograde signaling also can be transmitted by the modification of transmembrane proteins bound to organelle outer membranes.

## HOW ARE ROS SIGNALS PERCEIVED AND TRANSMITTED TO THE NUCLEUS?

One possibility is that redox changes within organelles are transmitted to the external membrane, where a receptor protein relays the signal to cytosolic pathways. 

As yet, little is known about such putative receptors in [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1)-related organelle-nucleus signaling, but precedents do exist.



Once [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1)-dependent signals reach the cytosol, they may largely be transmitted by mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades that are known to be important in stress responses.



Another possibility is that redox metabolites such as [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) are transported from organelles ([Fig. 2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#F2)).

Given the short lifetime of [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) within the cell, it is unclear to what extent this could function as a signal-transducing mechanism.



it is not clear how this happens, but studies of mutants lacking both catalase and NADPH oxidase functions (AtRbohD or AtRbohF) clearly suggest that processes such as salicylic acid (SA) and related defense signaling can be regulated by the interplay between apoplastic and intracellular ROS.

in most of these cases, activation of phytohormone synthesis has to be preceded by ROS signal transduction to the nucleus to up-regulate the expression of the appropriate synthesis pathway genes.



singlet oxygen may modify gene expression through carotenoid breakdown products, some of which are volatile(挥发性).



one example of a redox-related factor that is transported across the chloroplast envelope is the metabolite 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate ([PAP](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-9)), a by-product of sulfur assimilation in the plastids.

Stress-induced increases in [PAP](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-9) lead to its movement to the cytosol through the PAPS translocator, allowing it to somehow modify nuclear gene expression.

Given that photosynthetic carbon metabolism is generally working orders of **magnitude faster** than sulfur assimilation in the light, **the export of malate and triose phosphate** from the chloroplast may influence the cytosolic (and nuclear) redox state on more rapid time scales than PAP



A number of ANAC and WRKY **transcription factors** have been implicated in both chloroplast and mitochondrial retrograde signaling



Conclude: The mechanistic links between mitochondrial [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) or other redox factors and nuclear gene expression remain elusive.

## ORGANELLAR EXTENSIONS: A HOTLINE TO THE NUCLEUS?

The transport of [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) or related compounds from organelles could theoretically transmit signals to the exterior, while the short lifetimes of [ROS](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-1) may limit the effectiveness.

Chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes can produce extensions in the form of fluid-filled tubules that contain the soluble components of the compartments. These structures are known as stromules (chloroplasts), matrixules (mitochondria), and peroxules (peroxisomes).



It has been known for some years that peroxule formation is stimulated by oxidative stress(is regulated by a specific protein localized on the chloroplast outer envelope membrane).

it has been reported that the transfer of signaling proteins and metabolites, such as [H2O2](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581.long#def-2), to the nucleus directly from the chloroplast



All kinds of plastids, not just chloroplasts, can form stromules and that they can associate closely with the plasma membrane, mitochondria and the nucleus.

This suggests that the direct transfer of proteins and metabolites between these organelles and the apoplast can occur. 



An analysis of chloroplast composition at different positions in the leaf revealed considerable heterogeneity that has been attributed to light piping effects. 

Thus, different chloroplasts, even within the same cell, may have different functions. 

Susceptible chloroplasts could be primed to function mainly as ROS-producing organelles rather than as photosynthetic ones.



Chloroplasts produce a number of different types of vesicles that have been implicated in the degradation of stromal proteins, but they also could **carry metabolites** such as ROS or other **redox-active compounds** like chlorophyll catabolites. 

Moreover, the formation of ROS-containing vesicles has been documented at the plasma membrane during biotic stress and in the vesicular trafficking system during stresses such as high salt.



## LONGER TERM SIGNALING DOWNSTREAM OF ROS

Some types of ROS-induced cell death are mediated by signaling processes rather than accumulated damage.

In view of this, we suggest that signaling is commonplace but that accumulated damage is quite rare. One reason is that the cell houses a plethora of policing systems that scour the horizon for oxidatively modified proteins and either repair them or remove them.(include autophagy)



Spatial range and temporal scale are likely to be key factors that distinguish different types of signaling.

Many ROS-dependent events occur on a longer time scale. In this respect, we can distinguish rapid ROS signaling that does not involve oxidative stress, perhaps occurring over seconds to minutes.



Ascorbate and glutathione transporters are at lower rate, changes in intracellular thiols that are associated with the activation of NPR1 occur over a period of hours.

increased oxidation of the chloroplast glutathione pool may be one factor that activates the neosynthesis of this key redox buffer.

![img](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/171/3/1581/F5.large.jpg)

each location may have more than one type of receptor, and there may be intricate interplay between them. In this way, the ROS language could be rich in vocabulary with a well-defined grammar.
